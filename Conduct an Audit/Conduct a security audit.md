CIA Stands for Confidentiality , Integrity and Availability

Before we can describe something as secure, we need to consider better what makes up security. When you want to judge the security of a system, you need to think in terms of the security triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).

Confidentiality ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data.
Integrity aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs.
Availability aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed.
