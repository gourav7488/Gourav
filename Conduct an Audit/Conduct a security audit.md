CIA Stands for Confidentiality , Integrity and Availability

Before we can describe something as secure, we need to consider better what makes up security. When you want to judge the security of a system, you need to think in terms of the security triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).

Confidentiality ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data.
Integrity aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs.
Availability aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed.


The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model in cybersecurity that represents the three core principles essential to securing information and systems:

## 1. Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can access sensitive data. This principle protects information from unauthorized access and disclosure.

## 2. Integrity
Integrity guarantees that data remains accurate and unaltered. It also includes mechanisms to detect any unauthorized changes, ensuring the trustworthiness of the information.

## 3. Availability
Availability ensures that information, systems, and services are accessible and operational when needed. It focuses on maintaining uptime and minimizing disruptions to authorized users.

These three principles work together to form the cornerstone of effective information security strategies.

## Beyond CIA we have to study two more things Belongs to security Piller

Going one more step beyond the CIA security triad, we can think of:

## 1.Authenticity:
Authentic means not fraudulent or counterfeit. Authenticity is about ensuring that the document/file/data is from the claimed source.
## 2.Nonrepudiation: 
Repudiate means refusing to recognize the validity of something. Nonrepudiation ensures that the original source cannot deny that they are the source of a particular document/file/data. This characteristic is indispensable for various domains, such as shopping, patient diagnosis, and banking.



## Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC)
Information security governance and compliance are necessary to maintain any organisation's overall security posture. But how to achieve it? Here comes the role of the Governance and Risk Compliance (GRC) framework. It focuses on steering the organisation's overall governance, enterprise risk management, and compliance in an integrated manner. 

GRC framework has the following three components:
## 1.Governance Component:
It is the rules, processes and policies to steer the organisation.
## 2.Risk Management Component
Risk refers to day-to-day technical processes to mitigate the risk.
## 3.Compliance Component
Steps taken to meet standards and run legally.

## An Example - GRC Framework in Financial Sector
To fully understand each component of GRC, it is necessary to understand it with real-world examples and scenarios. In the ensuing section, we will see how the financial industry implements each component of the GRC framework:

## Governance-Related Activities: 
Nominate the governance level executives, and make financial-related policies such as bank secrecy act, anti-money laundering policy, financial audit policies, financial reporting, crisis management, and many more.

## Risk Management Activities: 
Identify potential risks, their possible outcomes, and countermeasures such as financial fraud risks, fraudulent transactions through cyber-attack, stolen credentials through phishing, fake ATM cards, etc.

## Compliance Activities: 
Take measures to meet legal requirements and industry standards such as PCI DSS, GLBA, etc. Moreover, this also includes implementing correct methods like SSL/ TLS to avoid Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks, ensuring automatic patch management against unpatched software, creating awareness campaigns for users to protect them from phishing attacks, and many more.


## NIST 800-53 (National Institute of standards and Technology)
NIST 800-53 is a publication titled`Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organisations`,  developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), US, that provides a catalogue of security controls to protect the CIA triad of information systems. The publication serves as a framework for organisations to assess and enhance the security and privacy of their information systems and comply with various laws, regulations, and policies. It incorporates best practices from multiple sources, including industry standards, guidelines, and international frameworks.

## Key Points
NIST 800-53 offers a comprehensive set of security and privacy controls that organisations can use to safeguard their operations, assets, personnel, and other organisations from various threats and risks. These include intentional attacks, unintentional errors, natural disasters, infrastructure failures, foreign intelligence activity, and privacy concerns. NIST 800-53 Revision 5 organises security controls into twenty families, each addressing a specific security concern category.

## Developing and Implementing NIST 800-53 based Information Security Program
Among all the families, "Program Management" is one of the crucial control of the NIST 800-53 framework. Program Management control mandates establishing, implementing, and monitoring organisation-wide programs for information security and privacy while safeguarding the processed, stored, or transmitted through systems. To ensure program management, the following subcontrols are necessary to be implemented:

## Compliance Best Practices
First and foremost, businesses must conduct a thorough discovery process to recognise and catalogue their data assets, information systems, and associated threats. This includes understanding **data flows, system dependencies, and potential vulnerabilities**.
The NIST 800-53 control families must be mapped to the **identified assets and hazards**, making creating a structured approach for matching the controls to the organisation's demands easier.

Thirdly, **creating a governance structure**, allocating duties, and outlining precise controls implementation and maintenance procedures are all necessary to effectively manage the implementation process. All measures must be **regularly monitored** and evaluated to ensure compliance. Finally, organisations should establish effective monitoring systems to identify and address security issues, conduct routine evaluations and audits, and improve control implementation. By adhering to these best practices, organisations can successfully implement NIST 800-53 and enhance their security outlook while mitigating risks effectively.
