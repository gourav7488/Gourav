CIA Stands for Confidentiality , Integrity and Availability

Before we can describe something as secure, we need to consider better what makes up security. When you want to judge the security of a system, you need to think in terms of the security triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).

Confidentiality ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data.
Integrity aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs.
Availability aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed.


The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model in cybersecurity that represents the three core principles essential to securing information and systems:

## 1. Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can access sensitive data. This principle protects information from unauthorized access and disclosure.

## 2. Integrity
Integrity guarantees that data remains accurate and unaltered. It also includes mechanisms to detect any unauthorized changes, ensuring the trustworthiness of the information.

## 3. Availability
Availability ensures that information, systems, and services are accessible and operational when needed. It focuses on maintaining uptime and minimizing disruptions to authorized users.

These three principles work together to form the cornerstone of effective information security strategies.

Going one more step beyond the CIA security triad, we can think of:

## 1.Authenticity:
Authentic means not fraudulent or counterfeit. Authenticity is about ensuring that the document/file/data is from the claimed source.
## 2.Nonrepudiation: 
Repudiate means refusing to recognize the validity of something. Nonrepudiation ensures that the original source cannot deny that they are the source of a particular document/file/data. This characteristic is indispensable for various domains, such as shopping, patient diagnosis, and banking.
