## Python
---
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. Python is widely used in web development, automation, data science, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity due to its simplicity and large standard library.

**Mathematical Operators**

Let's now study about the mathematical operators and how they can be applied to python. Like a calculator, there are operations such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and diviving; using python,

| Operator      | Syntax | Example        |
|---------------|--------|----------------|
| Addition      | `+`    | `1 + 1 = 2`     |
| Subtraction   | `-`    | `5 - 1 = 4`     |
| Multiplication| `*`    | `10 * 10 = 100` |
| Division      | `/`    | `10 / 2 = 5`    |
| Modulus       | `%`    | `10 % 2 = 0`    |
| Exponent      | `**`   | `5 ** 2 = 25`   |

And now we can some basic mathematical operators, lets move on to comparision opetators; these play a big part in python and will be built upon when we look at _loops_ and _if statements_.

| Symbol                     | Syntax |
|----------------------------|--------|
| Greater than               | `>`    |
| Less than                  | `<`    |
| Equal to                   | `==`   |
| Not Equal to               | `!=`   |
| Greater than or equal to   | `>=`   |
| Less than or equal to      | `<=`   |


# Variabls and Data Types

Variables allow you to store and update data in a computer program. You have a variable name and store data to that name.

<pre lang="md"> ```python food = "ice cream" money = 2000 print("I have", money, "to buy", food) ``` </pre>
